              We are proud to use VIBRAXIS - the ultimate in vibration training.
              Vibration training works all the major muscle groups in less time
              than conventional exercise, and just 10 minutes a day in the
              standing position on the VIBRAXIS is the equivalent to one hours
              resistance training. You can drop a dress size in just one month!
              VIBRAXIS reduces body fat & cellulite, improves muscle tone &
              strength and improves your health & well being.
