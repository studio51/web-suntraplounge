                The SkinBase Microdermabrasion Facial is a safe, controlled treatment that intensely exfoliates &amp;resurfaces the skin for complete skin rejuvenation.

              p.
                A fine jet of abrasive crystals gently removes dead skin cells layer by layer &amp; a vacuum action lifts away the debris, stimulating the blood flow and encouraging collagen &amp; elastin formulation that results in firmer, revitalised and youthful looking skin.

              p.
                Wrinkles disappear, acne scarring is reduced and dull &amp; tired skin is completely banished. Results can be seen after just one treatment!
